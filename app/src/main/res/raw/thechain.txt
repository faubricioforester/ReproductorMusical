[Verse 1]
Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies

[Hook]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Verse 2]
Listen to the wind blow, down comes the night
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence, damn the dark, damn the light

[Hook]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Outro]
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
